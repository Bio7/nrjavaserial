# nrjavaserial

This is a fork of the now-defunct RXTX serial library with a focus on ease of use and embeddability. The Java APIs and native components are distributed within a single JAR, easing integration with other projects. Additionally, numerious issues found within the last released version of RXTX have been resolved, and new features are being added. For more information, see the [GitHub project](https://github.com/NeuronRobotics/nrjavaserial).
